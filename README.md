## Description

ioBroker adapter for [**Hoymiles**](https://www.hoymiles.com/) **HMS-xxxW-xT** microinverters with integrated WiFi DTU (DTUBI).

Two connection modes (independently configurable):
- **Local:** Direct TCP/Protobuf communication on port 10081 — no cloud, no gateway needed
- **Cloud:** Hoymiles S-Miles Cloud API — monthly/yearly energy, CO2 savings, income calculation

## Documentation

[English Documentation](docs/en/README.md)

[Deutsche Dokumentation](docs/de/README.md)

## Features

- Dual mode: local TCP/Protobuf and/or S-Miles Cloud API
- Continuous polling with request queue for reliable data retrieval
- Performance data mode for real-time monitoring
- Configurable poll pause between cycles (0 = fastest possible)
- Configurable slow poll factor for config/alarm queries (reduces DTU traffic)
- Real-time data: power, voltage, current, frequency, energy, temperature
- Per-panel monitoring (PV0/PV1)
- Energy aggregates: daily, monthly, yearly, total (kWh)
- Income calculation based on electricity price (cloud)
- CO2 savings tracking (cloud)
- Power limit control (2-100%), inverter on/off/reboot, DTU reboot
- Alarm and warning monitoring (109 codes DE/EN)
- AES encryption support for newer DTU firmware
- Network discovery module for ioBroker.discovery
- TypeScript, ESLint, Prettier, GitHub CI/CD
- Full i18n: en, de, ru, pt, nl, fr, it, es, pl, uk, zh-cn

## Configuration

Open the adapter configuration in the ioBroker admin interface.

### Local Connection (TCP)

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| **Enable local** | on | Enable direct TCP/Protobuf connection |
| **DTU Host** | (empty) | IP address or hostname of the inverter. Leave empty for auto-discovery on adapter start. |
| **Pause between polls** | 0 | Pause between poll cycles in seconds. 0 = no pause (fastest possible, ~2-4s per cycle). |
| **Config/alarm poll factor** | 6 | Config and alarms are only queried every Nth poll. Reduces DTU traffic during fast polling. |

### Cloud Connection (S-Miles)

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| **Enable cloud** | off | Enable Hoymiles S-Miles Cloud API |
| **S-Miles Email** | — | Your S-Miles account email |
| **S-Miles Password** | — | Your S-Miles account password (stored encrypted) |
| **DTU Serial** | (empty) | For multiple inverters in your account: enter DTU serial to match the correct one. Leave empty for single inverter setups. |
| **Cloud Poll Interval** | 300s | Cloud query interval (60-3600 seconds) |

Both connections can be enabled simultaneously. Local data has priority — cloud data fills in when the DTU is offline (e.g. at night).

## Supported Inverters

This adapter is designed for **Hoymiles HMS microinverters with integrated WiFi DTU** (DTUBI):

**1 String (1T):**

| Model | Status |
|-------|--------|
| HMS-300W-1T | Untested |
| HMS-350W-1T | Untested |
| HMS-400W-1T | Untested |
| HMS-450W-1T | Untested |
| HMS-500W-1T | Untested |

**2 Strings (2T):**

| Model | Status |
|-------|--------|
| HMS-600W-2T | Untested |
| HMS-700W-2T | Untested |
| HMS-800W-2T | **Tested** (Local + Cloud) |
| HMS-900W-2T | Untested |
| HMS-1000W-2T | Untested |

**4 Strings (4T) — only DW variant:**

| Model | Status |
|-------|--------|
| HMS-1600DW-4T | Untested |
| HMS-1800DW-4T | Untested |
| HMS-2000DW-4T | Untested |

> **Important:** This adapter **only** works with HMS models that have **integrated WiFi**. It does **NOT** work with:
> - HMS-1600/1800/2000-4T **without** "DW" (these use Sub-1G RF and need an external DTU)
> - HM series (no WiFi, RF only)
> - MI series (no WiFi, RF only)
> - HMS/HMT with external DTU-Pro or DTU-WLite sticks
> - HMT three-phase models

## Multiple Inverters

If you have multiple inverters, simply create multiple adapter instances:

- `hoymiles.0` → Inverter 1 (e.g. 192.168.178.87)
- `hoymiles.1` → Inverter 2 (e.g. 192.168.178.88)

Each instance has its own configuration and runs independently.
